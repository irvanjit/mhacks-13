Mango - MHacks-13 hack
----------------------

###NFC Contact Sharing on Android.

Mango is a project that demonstrates server-syncronized NFC contact info sharing on Android.

It was developed during the MHacks 2013 hackathon (we didn't submit for judging) at a time when the Android NFC API was still in its infancy.
