Mango - MHacks-13
-----------------

####NFC Contact Sharing on Android.

Mango is a project that demonstrates server-syncronized NFC contact info sharing on Android.

It was developed during the MHacks 2013 hackathon (we didn't submit for judging) at a time when the Android NFC API was still in its infancy and so was a proof-of-concept of sorts at the time.
